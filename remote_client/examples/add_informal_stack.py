"""This is simply a helper program to get the demo site complete.  It fetches
the ID of the sample 14S-001 and attaches informal layers to it by leading an
ad-hoc generated fixture.  This is not very elegangt but as long as there is no
facility in the remote client library to add informal stacks, this is the way
to go.
