"""Helper routines for the various structuring layouts in the institute.
Layouts can create image maps for the browser so that one can click on single
structures on the layout.  And, they can draw themselves and write it to a PDF
file.

Layouts are set by the `institute.models.Structuring` process.  It defines the
structuring layout that was used for all following processes.  In the lab, most
layouts are realised with masks.

So far, we have only the cell structuring layouts implemented.  They are used
in the solarsimulator measurements.
