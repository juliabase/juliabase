"""View for editing the “My Layers” structure.  See
:py:attr:`samples.models.UserDetails.my_steps` for the syntax of the “My Steps”
field.  In the INM institute app, we use My Steps only for deposition layers,
therefore, we call it My Layers.  However, you are free to add views for other
“My …”, and filter the process classes as you need.  The ``my_steps`` field
will always store the union of all these processes.
