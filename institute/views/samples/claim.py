    """View for adding a new claim to old-style sample names.  This is a nice
    example of a view of the app “samples” which is *extended* in the institute
    app.  The template – in this case,
    :file:`institute/templates/samples/list_claims.html` – overrides and extends the
    default one, and adds a link to a URL listed in institute's URLconf and pointing
    to this view function.

    The important step is the template.  This is the hook for your extensions.
    You override the template from “samples” by creating a file called the same
    in :file:`institute/templates/samples/`.  Because ``DIRS`` and ``loaders``
    are defined as recommended in :doc:`/programming/settings`, it shadows its
    counterpart.  By giving the full path, you can still access the original.
    Thus, you may start your template with

    ::

        {% extends "samples/templates/samples/list_claims.html" %}

    in order to extend it.

    The `username` parameter of this view function is actually superfluous
    because it must be the currently logged-in user anyway.  But this way, we
    don't get into trouble if a user happens to be called ``"add"``.
    Additionally, the URLs become RESTful.

    :param request: the current HTTP Request object
    :param username: the name of the user whose claim this will be; it must be
        the currently logged-in user

    :type request: HttpRequest
    :type username: str

    :return:
      the HTTP response object
