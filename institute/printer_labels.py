"""Module for generating PDFs for the label printer.  These labels contain the
sample name and a QR code with the sample ID.  The most challenging task here
is to bring even long sample names on the label properly by compressing them
and/or splitting them into two lines.

All dimension variables here are in big points (bp) because this is the native
unit of measurement in ReportLab.
