"""Central permission checking.  This module consists of three parts: First,
the exception that is raised if a certain permission condition is not met.
Secondly, the assertion functions that test for certain permissions.  And
thirdly, top-level code that generates a ``has_permission_to_...`` function for
every ``assert_can_...`` function.

The idea is the following.  For example, there is a function called
``assert_can_fully_view_sample``.  If the user can't view the sample, a
``PermissionError`` is raised.  Sometimes however, you just want to check it
without having to catch an exception.  Then, you use
``has_permission_to_fully_view_sample``.  The parameters are the same but
instead of raising an exception, it returns ``True`` or ``False``.

The ``assert_can_...`` function are typically used at the beginning of views
where permissions need to be checked and every failure means an error.  By
contrast, the ``has_permission_to_...`` functions are used where a missing
permission just means that e.g. a link is not generated (for example, in the
``get_context_for_user`` methods in the models).
