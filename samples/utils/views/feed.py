"""Code for generating feed entries.  They are called by views shortly after
the database was changed in one way or another.

__all__ = ("Reporter",)


class Reporter:
    """This class contains all feed-generating routines as methods.  Their
    names start with ``report_...``.  The main reason for putting them into a
    class is that this class assures that no user gets two feed entries.
    Therefore, if you want to report a certain database change to the users,
    create an instance of ``Reporter`` and call all methods that are related to
    the database change.  Call the most meaningful method first, and the most
    general last.  For example, when changing the data of a sample, the
    respective view calls the following methods in this order::

        report_new_responsible_person_samples
        report_changed_sample_topic
        report_edited_samples

    Of course, the first two are only called if the respective data change
    really happend.  Thus, the new responsible person is signalled first, then
    all people about a possible topic change, and if this didn't happen, all
    so-far un-signalled users get a general message about changed sample data.

    If you want to signal something to all possibly interested users, no matter
    on which feed entries they already have received, just create a new
    instance of ``Reporter``.

    Mostly, you can call the method directly without binding the instance of
    ``Reporter`` to a name, as in::

        feed_utils.Reporter(request.user).report_result_process(
                result, edit_description=None)

      feed entry by a call to `__connect_with_users`

    :ivar already_informed_users: All users who have already received a feed
      entry from this instance of ``Reporter``.  They won't get a second
      entry.
