class OperatorField(forms.ChoiceField):
    # FixMe: This is the new variant of :py:class:`FixedOperatorField`.  It
    # makes :py:class:`FixedOperatorField` obsolete.
    """Form field class for the selection of a single operator.  This is
    intended for edit-process views when the operator must be the currently
    logged-in user, an external contact of that user, or the previous
    (external) operator.  It can be used in model forms.

    Normally, you use this field through :py:class:`ProcessForm`.

    The result of this field (if there was no validation error) is a tuple of
    two values, namely the operator and the external operator.  Exactly one of
    both is ``None`` if the respective type of operator was not given.

    It is senseful to show this field only to non-staff, and staff gets the
    usual operator/external operator fields.  In the IEK-5/FZJ implementation,
    we even allow all three fields for staff users as long as there no
    contradicting values are given.

    If you want to use this field for *non-staff*, do the following things:

    1. This field must be made required

    2. Make the possible choices of the operator and the external operator
       fields empty.  Exclude those fields from the HTML.

    3. Check in your ``clean()`` method whether non-staff submits an operator.
       Since the operator is required in ``samples.models.Process``, you must
       provide a senseful default for the operator if none was returned
       (because an external operator was selected).  I recommend to use the
       currently logged-in user in this case.

    A good example is in :py:mod:`institute.views.samples.substrate` of the INM
    adaption of JuliaBase.  There, you can also see how one can deal with staff
    users (especially interesting for the remote client).
