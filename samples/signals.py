"""The samples database app.  This module contains the signal listeners.  Most
of them are for cache expiring, but `expire_feed_entries` cleans up the feed
entries queue.


Caching in JuliaBase-Samples
============================

Since this module contains a lot of JuliaBase-Samples' caching code, it is the
right place to say some general words about it.  It is rather complicated and
scattered over a couple of modules, so it is important to document it
thoroughly.


Goals
.....

We need caching of the most-accessed pages, especially if they are costly to
generate, too.  These are the samples view, the sample series view, and the
main menu page.  We implement a three-level cache:

1. The browser cache.  It is activated with ``last_modified`` functions for all
   three views.  If the page hasn't been modified since the user has last
   accessed it, a 304 (Not Modified) is returned by the server.  Additionally,
   we generate ETags because some browsers ignore "Vary: Cookie" and show a
   cached page to a different user.

2. The samples cache.  This is only used for the samples view.  Whole samples
   are stored in the cache as a special data structure called
   :py:class:`~samples.views.sample.SamplesAndProcesses`.  In order to increase
   cache efficiency, this data structure can be re-used for different users.
   Additionally, it is stored multiple times in the cache, for different
   “layout settings” (language, skin).  However, it becomes invalid if the
   sample or some of the displayed information is changed.

3. The processes cache.  Every process may be cached so that a sample or sample
   series view may be built from cached items.

These three levels are tried from top to bottom.


Cache invalidation
..................

Of course, the server must never serve outdated data to the user.  In order to
prevent that, every change in the database triggers deletion of those cache
items which have become obsolete.  This is very difficult to achive because
JuliaBase-Samples contains so many inter-model dependencies (partly indirect).

It may also be possible to compare timestamps in order to detect obsolete cache
items, however, calculating these timestamps is not much easier and required
more work for read accesses, but it is sensible to do as much computation as
possible after write accesses because they occur much more seldomly.

There is no silver bullet for reliable cache invalidation.  On the contrary,
one must go through all models and determine those cached models which are
affected by changes in the first models.  There is not even a good general
strategy for this.  I myself made a big table with paper and pencil.

The best approach is to have in mind the six models that need to be “touched”
in order to delete cache items or to update a last-modified timestamp:

1. ``Sample``.  This contains both a ``last_modified`` timestamp and a list of
   cache items.

2. ``Process``.  The same as with ``Sample``.

3. ``Clearance``.  This contains a ``last_modified``.  ``Clearance`` is very
   low-maintenance: ``last_modified`` is auto-updated whenever the respective
   ``Clearance`` instance is saved, and it doesn't depend on data from any
   other model.

4. ``SampleSeries``.  This contains a ``last_modified``, which is also
   auto-updated whenever the respective series is saved.

5. ``UserDetails``.  This contains a ``display_settings_timestamp`` which is
   the last time the user has changed things that affect display of samples and
   sample series (topic memberships, clearances, etc).  Moreover, it contains
   ``my_samples_timestamp`` which is the last time the user has changed his “My
   Samples”.

   Additionally, the ``UserDetails`` of ``jb_common`` contain the field
   ``layout_last_modified`` which is updated when language or browser are
   changed (this also affects display of samples and sample series).

Note that ``SampleSplit`` needs special treatment because it is the only
process which contains sample data (namely the sample's name).  Additionally,
it is the only process the visual representation of which depends on the sample
it is listed with.  The latter is realised by an extended cache key which
contains also the context of the split.

Also note that ``Result`` is special because it can be connected with sample
series.  This way, it may be included into sample data sheets indirectly.  You
see, there's a lot to consider.


Cache invalidation helper methods in ``models/common.py``
.........................................................

A couple of methods have been added to the core models in order to make cache
invalidation more convenient.

First, a couple of models have custom ``save()`` methods which update the
``last_modified`` timestamps.  Some of them have a ``with_relations`` keyword
parameter.  If this is ``True`` (the default), all dependent instances (via
foreign-key or M2M relationships) are touched too.  However normally, the
maximal nesting depth is 1 in order to prevent endless loops.

The special ``save()`` parameters should only be used by other ``save()``
methods or the cache-related signal function in this module.  In particular,
you should not use them in views code.

The same warning applies to the model method ``touch_display_settings``.


Cache invalidation for M2M relationships
........................................

If an M2M relationship changes, no instance in saved.  Thus, we cannot do
proper cache invalidation via ``save()`` methods.  Instead, we use signal
routines in this module.  Additionally, this module contains signal routines
for Django's ``User`` model because we cannot change its ``save()`` method in a
clean way.

Although even many changes which can only be applied through the admin
interface of Django are dealt with in JuliaBase-Samples' cache invalidation
code, some changes are not.  For example, if you change the name of a sample
series, you must purge the cache manually.  This is done for efficiency
reasons.  The name of a sample series shouldn't change after all, and cannot be
changed from within JuliaBase-Samples.


Multihop touches
................

In rare cases, the nesting depth of followed relations for cache invalidation
is greater than 1:

``Result`` → ``SampleSeries`` → ``Sample``

``User``/``ExternalOperator`` → ``Process`` → ``Sample``

``User``/``ExternalOperator`` → ``Result`` → ``SampleSeries``
