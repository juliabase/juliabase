"""Collected views for dealing with sample series.

Names of sample series are of the form ``originator-YY-name``, where
``originator`` is the person who created the sample series, and ``YY`` is the
year (two digits). ``name`` is almost arbitrary.  Names of sample series can't
be changed once they have been created.
