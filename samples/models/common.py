        or adapt existing fields to the given user.  Note that adaption only
        happens to the current user and not to any settings like e.g. language.
        In other words, if a non-empty `old_context` is passed, the caller must
        assure that language etc is already correct, just that it may be a
        cached context from another user with different permissions.

        A process context has always the following fields: ``process``,
        ``html_body``, ``name``, ``operator``, ``timestamp``, and
        ``timestamp_inaccuracy``.  Optional standard fields are ``edit_url``,
        ``export_url``, ``duplicate_url``, and ``delete_url``.  It may also
        have further fields, which must be interpreted by the respective
        ``"show_…"`` template.

        It is very important to see that ``html_body`` (the result of the
        ``show_<process name>.html`` template) must not depend on sample data!
        Otherwise, you see outdated process data after having changed sample
        data.  (There is only one exception: sample splits.)  If you really
        need this dependency, then expire the cached sample items yourself in a
        signal function.

        Note that it is necessary that ``self`` is the actual instance and not
        a parent class.
