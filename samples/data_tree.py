        nodes which don't have a strict set of items.  An example are result
        processes: The user is completely free which items he gives them.  This
        irritates ``build_column_group_list``: It takes the *first* node of a
        certain ``name`` (for example ``"Nice result"``) and transforms its
        items to table columns.

        But what if the second ``"Nice result"`` for the same sample has other
        items?  This shouldn't happen certainly, but it will.  Here, we add
        the missing items (with empty strings as value).

        It must be called after `find_unambiguous_names` because the completion
        of item keys is only necessary within one column group, and the column
        groups base on the names created by ``find_unambiguous_names``.  In
        other words, if ``Nice result`` and ``Nice result #2`` don't share the
        same item keys, this is unimportant.  But if ``Nice result #2`` of two
        samples in the exported series didn't share the same item keys, this
        would result in a ``KeyError`` exception in
        :py:meth:`samples.views.table_export.Column.get_value`.

        This is not optimal for performance reasons.  But it is much easier
        than to train `build_column_group_list` to handle it.

            that in contrast to `key_sets`, the keys of this are the nodes
            themselves rather than the disambiguated node names.  It is used

    :ivar origin: an optional name of the class from where this data item comes
      from.  Its necessity is not easy to explain.  The problem is that we have
      inheritance in the models, for example, a deposition is derived from
      `samples.models.Process`.  When calling the ``get_data`` method of a
      deposition, it first calls the ``get_data`` method of
      ``samples.models.Process``, which adds operator, timestamp, and comments
      to the items list.  However, the same is true for all other processes.

      But this means that e.g. the “timestamp” column ends up in different
      column groups when exporting the processes as rows in a table.  That's
      rubbish because it's actually always the same property.

      Thus, in order to preserve inheritance, such inherited attributes are
      called “shared columns” in JuliaBase's CSV export.  They are marked with
      a non-``None`` ``origin`` parameter which just contains a symbol for the
      model class, e.g. ``"process"`` for ``samples.models.Process``.
