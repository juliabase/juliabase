   :description: JuliaBase is an open-source web framework written in Python
                 for creating databases for samples or specimens as used in
                 research and development.


============
Introduction
============

Your scientific institute or working group creates lots of samples, and your
team needs a tool to keep track of them?  JuliaBase is made for exactly that!
It is a database solution for samples, their processing and their
characterization, with the following features:

- intuitive browser-based interface, fully working even on mobile devices
- maximal flexibility for being adapted perfectly to your production and
  measurement setups, and to your workflows
- possibility to manage more than one department in a single database
- fine-grained access control
- connects to your LDAP server for user management
- keeps track of samples across sample splits
- support for pre-evaluating raw data and creating plots
- automatic notification of changes in your samples
- sample management by sample series, topics, and tags
- arbitrarily complex searches made easy, e.g. “find all samples with infrared
  measurements, deposited together with a sample on glass substrate with a
  conductivity greater than :math:`10^{-6}` S/cm; oh yes, and only from this year and made
  by John”
- export to spreadsheets
- automatic lab notebooks
- database interaction from own programs, e.g. for connecting your measurement
  setup directly to the database
- fully translatable; core is available in English and German so far
- fully brandable; adjust the look to your corporate identity and/or your taste
- mature codebase
- compliance with state-of-the-art Web standards and security considerations
- fully open source

We believe that the database should adapt to the people and the existing
workflows rather than the other way round!

However, there is no free lunch … JuliaBase's flexibility comes at a cost.  You
have to create the Python code to describe your setups and apparatuses.
Leaving out fancy things, this is copy, paste, and modify of < 100 lines of
code for each apparatus.  JuliaBase contains code for typical processing and
measurement setups that you can use as a starting point.

Technical overview
==================

For better evaluation, here is a short list of the technical aspects of
JuliaBase:

- JuliaBase is built on top of the `Django web framework`_.
- JuliaBase is written 100% in the Python programming language.
- Although other setups are possible, the easiest server installation bases on
  Linux, PostgreSQL, and Apache.
- Hardware requirements are very low; a 100 people institute could be served by
  a single ordinary desktop computer.

Public releases
===============

You can `download JuliaBase`_ from GitHub as .tar.gz or zip files.
Alternatively, you may visit the current state of the `source code repository`_
there.

Getting started
===============

If you want to give JuliaBase a try, visit the :doc:`demo site <demo>`.  If you
like it, the next step could be :doc:`installing it
</programming/installation>`.  Its installation includes the demo site, so you
have immediately something up and running, and you can evaluate it even better.

If you consider actually using JuliaBase, have a look at the full :doc:`table
of contents <toc>`.  This documentation also exists `in PDF format`_.
