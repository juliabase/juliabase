.. index:: settings

==================
Settings reference
==================


In order to have the default values for the following settings available, you
must start your :file:`settings.py` with::

    from jb_common.settings_defaults import *
    from samples.settings_defaults import *

We recommend to use the :file:`settings.py` in JuliaBase's root directory as a
starting point.


General JuliaBase settings
==========================


.. index:: ADD_SAMPLES_VIEW

ADD_SAMPLES_VIEW
----------------

Default: ``""`` (Empty string)

Name of the view to add samples.  For example::

    ADD_SAMPLES_VIEW = "institute:add_samples"

This view function must have exactly one parameter, namely the ``request``
instance.


.. index:: CACHE_ROOT

CACHE_ROOT
----------

Default: ``"/tmp/juliabase_cache"``

The path where dispensable (in the sense of re-creatable) files are stored.
JuliaBase mostly uses this directory to store images, e.g. plot files.  If the
path doesn't exist when the JuliaBase service is started, it is created.  The
default value should be changed to e.g. ``"/var/cache/juliabase"``.  Note that
such a path needs to be created by you because Juliabase doesn't have the
necessary permissions.  Also note that such a path needs to be writable by the
webserver process JuliaBase is running on.


.. index:: CRAWLER_LOGS_ROOT

CRAWLER_LOGS_ROOT
-----------------

Default: ``""`` (Empty string)

Path to the crawlers' log files.  In this directory, the log file for a
particular process class is called :file:`{class_name}.log`.  Mind the
spelling: ``MyProcessClassName`` becomes :file:`my_process_class_name.log`.


.. index:: CRAWLER_LOGS_WHITELIST

CRAWLER_LOGS_WHITELIST
----------------------

Default: ``[]`` (Empty list)

List of process classes for which the crawler log is public, i.e. not
restricted to users that are allowed to add new processes of that kind.


.. index:: DEBUG_EMAIL_REDIRECT_USERNAME

DEBUG_EMAIL_REDIRECT_USERNAME
-----------------------------

Default: ``""`` (Empty string)

Username of a user to which all outgoing email should be sent if the Django
setting ``DEBUG=True``.  If this name is invalid, in particular if it is empty,
no emails are sent at all in debugging mode.  This prevents embarrassment
caused by emails sent to other people while merely debugging your code.


.. index:: HELP_LINK_PREFIX

HELP_LINK_PREFIX
----------------

Default:: ``"http://www.juliabase.org/"``

URL prefix to be prepended to all help link given in the
:py:func:`~jb_common.utils.base.help_link` decorator.


.. index:: INITIALS_FORMATS
.. _INITIALS_FORMATS:

INITIALS_FORMATS
----------------

Default::

    INITIALS_FORMATS = \
        {"user": {"pattern": r"[A-Z]{2,4}|[A-Z]{2,3}\d|[A-Z]{2}\d{2}",
                  "description": _("The initials start with two uppercase letters.  "
                                   "They contain uppercase letters and digits only.  "
                                   "Digits are at the end.")},
         "external_contact": {
                  "pattern": r"[A-Z]{4}|[A-Z]{3}\d|[A-Z]{2}\d{2}",
                  "description": _("The initials start with two uppercase letters.  "
                                   "They contain uppercase letters and digits only.  "
                                   "Digits are at the end.  "
                                   "The length is exactly 4 characters.")}
         }

This maps the kind of initials to their properties.  It must contain exactly
the two keys ``"user"`` and ``"external_contact"``.  See :ref:`Initials` for
more information.


.. index:: JAVASCRIPT_I18N_APPS

JAVASCRIPT_I18N_APPS
--------------------

Default: ``["django.contrib.auth", "samples", "jb_common"]``

List containing all apps which contain translations that should be used in
JavaScript code.  The apps are named as in the Django setting
``INSTALLED_APPS``.  See the `Django documentation
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/translation/#internationalization-in-javascript-code>`__
for further information.


.. index:: MERGE_CLEANUP_FUNCTION

MERGE_CLEANUP_FUNCTION
----------------------

Default: ``""`` (Empty string)

Name of the view in Python's dot notation which points to a function which is
called after each sample merge.  This function must take exactly two
parameters, the sample that is merged and the sample that this sample is merged
into.  It is possible to leave this settings empty; then, nothing special is
called.


.. index:: NAME_PREFIX_TEMPLATES

NAME_PREFIX_TEMPLATES
---------------------

Default: ``[]`` (Empty list)

List of string templates that define possible sample name prefixes.  See
:doc:`sample_names` for more information.


.. index:: SAMPLE_NAME_FORMATS

SAMPLE_NAME_FORMATS
-------------------

Default::

    SAMPLE_NAME_FORMATS = {"provisional": {"possible_renames": {"default"}},
                           "default":     {"pattern": r"[-A-Za-z_/0-9#()]*"}}

This setting defines which sample names are allowed in your database.  It maps
the names of the formats to their properties.  See :doc:`sample_names` for more
information.


.. index:: TEMP_STATIC_DIRS

TEMP_STATIC_DIRS
----------------

Default: ``[]``

Contains a list of directories from which temporary static files are served
which should be deleted immediately after having been served.

Important: If `USE_X_SENDFILE`_ is ``True``, all temporary static files are
served by the ``X-Sendfile-Temporary`` header.  When using Apache with at least
version 1.0 of `mod_xsendfile`_, this means that Apache serves the file and
immediately deletes it afterwards.  You have to set the Apache flag
``AllowFileDelete`` correctly for this to work.

.. _mod_xsendfile: http://www.juliabase.org/downloads/impressum.html


.. index:: THUMBNAIL_WIDTH

THUMBNAIL_WIDTH
---------------

Default: ``400``

This number represents the width in pixels of the thumbnails of plots and
images that are generated for the sample data sheet.


.. index:: USE_X_SENDFILE

USE_X_SENDFILE
--------------

Default: ``False``

If ``True``, JuliaBase assumes that the web server is interpreting the
``X-Sendfile`` header and serves a static file (e.g. an image) itself.
Otherwise, JuliaBase serves the file, which may be slower and more
time-consuming.  In most cases, it doesn't matter, though.


.. index:: LDAP

Settings for LDAP
=================


.. index:: LDAP_ACCOUNT_FILTER

LDAP_ACCOUNT_FILTER
-------------------

Default: ``"(!(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2))"``

LDAP filter for filtering LDAP members that are eligible for JuliaBase access.
The default filter finds any member which is not inactive.  The default value
works well for Active Directory domain controllers.


.. index:: LDAP_ADDITIONAL_ATTRIBUTES

LDAP_ADDITIONAL_ATTRIBUTES
--------------------------

Default: ``[]`` (Empty list)

JuliaBase limits the attributes it receives for every user to a certain subset,
e.g. the user's real name and their department.  If your code needs additional
LDAP attributes, put their names into this list.  An example might be::

    LDAP_ADDITIONAL_ATTRIBUTES = ["telephoneNumber", "msExchUserCulture",
                                  "physicalDeliveryOfficeName"]


.. index:: LDAP_ADDITIONAL_USERS

LDAP_ADDITIONAL_USERS
---------------------

Default: ``{}`` (Empty dict)

Dictionary mapping user names to JuliaBase department names.  This contains
users that are in the LDAP directory but are not in one of the departments
listed in the setting `LDAP_DEPARTMENTS`_ explained below.  The use case is
that some people working in the organization but not in the department(s) may
still be eligible for database access.  By putting them in
``LDAP_ADDITIONAL_USERS``, they are allowed to login.  They are associated with
the department they are mapped to.


.. index:: LDAP_DEPARTMENTS

LDAP_DEPARTMENTS
----------------

Default: ``{}`` (Empty dict)

Dictionary mapping LDAP department names to JuliaBase department names.  If
your LDAP directory data sets contain the "department" attribute, this setting
determines which department get access to JuliaBase.  If this setting is empty,
all LDAP members get access.

If the LDAP doesn't contain the "department" attribute, this setting should be
empty.


.. index:: LDAP_GROUPS_TO_PERMISSIONS

LDAP_GROUPS_TO_PERMISSIONS
--------------------------

Default: ``{}`` (Empty dict)

Dictionary mapping LDAP group names to sets of Django permission names.  Use
the Django ``codename`` of the permission, without any app label.  An example
might be::

    LDAP_GROUPS_TO_PERMISSIONS = {
            "TG_IEF-5_teamleaders": {"view_every_sample", "adopt_samples",
                                     "edit_permissions_for_all_physical_processes",
                                     "add_externaloperator",
                                     "view_every_externaloperator",
                                     "add_topic", "change_topic"}
        }

Note that you should not change permissions in JuliaBase's admin interface that
occur in ``LDAP_GROUPS_TO_PERMISSIONS``.  They will be overwritten during the
next synchronization with the LDAP directory (in particular, at next user
login).  Consider these permissions being managed exclusively automatically.


.. index:: LDAP_LOGIN_TEMPLATE

LDAP_LOGIN_TEMPLATE
-------------------

Default: ``"{username}"``

This pattern is used to bind to (a.k.a. login into) the LDAP server.  JuliaBase
uses this binding only to check whether the user's credentials (login,
password) are valid.  ``{username}`` is replaced by the username of the user
that tries to login into JuliaBase.  A typical value for this setting is

::

   LDAP_LOGIN_TEMPLATE = "{username}@mycompany.com"


.. index:: LDAP_PASSWORD

LDAP_PASSWORD
-------------

Default: ``None``

Login password of the functional LDAP user that is used to bind to the LDAP for
retrieving data.  In some LDAP configurations, anonymous binding is allowed.
Then, you don't need this setting.


.. index:: LDAP_SEARCH_DN

LDAP_SEARCH_DN
--------------

Default: ``""`` (Empty string)

The “distinguished name” (DN) which should be used as the base of the search
for user details in the LDAP directory.  It is typically something like::

    LDAP_SEARCH_DN = "DC=ad,DC=mycompany,DC=com"


.. index:: LDAP_URLS

LDAP_URLS
---------

Default: ``[]`` (Empty list)

List of URLs of LDAP directories.  If you want to use LDAP, this must contain
at least one URL.  It may contain more if there are multiple redundant LDAP
servers.  In this case, JuliaBase will try each of them until it finds a
working one.  An example value may be::

    LDAP_URLS = ["ldaps://dc-e01.ad.mycompany.com:636"]

Here, 636 is the port number of LDAP-over-TLS.  Note that in order to use TLS,
you must start the URL with ``ldaps://``.


.. index:: LDAP_USER

LDAP_USER
---------

Default: ``None``

Login name of the functional LDAP user that is used to bind to the LDAP for
retrieving data.  In some LDAP configurations, anonymous binding is allowed.
Then, you don't need this setting.  Note that `LDAP_LOGIN_TEMPLATE`_ is applied
to this name.


.. index:: JB_LOGGING_PATH

JB_LOGGING_PATH
---------------

Default: ``"/tmp/jb_common.log"``

Path to the log file of JuliaBase.  Currently, it only logs the requests with
timestamps, URL, and the currently logged-in user.


Django settings with special meaning in JuliaBase
=================================================

Note that JuliaBase does not change the meaning or the default value of Django
settings.


.. index:: LANGUAGES (setting)

LANGUAGES
---------

This settings determines which flags to offer at the top of the screen.  Since
JuliaBase is available in English and German so far, a sensible value may be::

    LANGUAGES = [("de", _("German")), ("en", _("English"))]

Note that the ``_(...)`` makes the language names themselves translatable.  To
get this working, you must import ``ugettext_lazy`` into :file:`settings.py`::

    from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _


.. index:: CACHES (setting)

CACHES
------

JuliaBase makes heavy use of Django's cache framework.  Thus, we recommend to
configure an efficient caching backend like Redis::

    CACHES = {
        "default": {
            "BACKEND": "django_redis.cache.RedisCache",
            "LOCATION": "redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1",
            "TIMEOUT": 3600 * 24 * 28,
            "OPTIONS": {
                "CLIENT_CLASS": "django_redis.client.DefaultClient",
                }
            }
        }


.. index:: DEBUG (setting)

DEBUG
-----

JuliaBase behaves slightly differently if ``DEBUG=True``.  In particular, all
outgoing emails are redirected to `DEBUG_EMAIL_REDIRECT_USERNAME`_.


.. index:: DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL

DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL
------------------

JuliaBase uses this Django setting also for its own outgoing emails.


.. index:: INSTALLED_APPS

INSTALLED_APPS
--------------

The minimal set of installed apps for JuliaBase is::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        "django.contrib.auth",
        "django.contrib.contenttypes",
        "django.contrib.sessions",
        "django.contrib.admin",
        "django.contrib.messages",
        "django.contrib.staticfiles",
        "institute",
        "samples",
        "jb_common"
    ]

Of course, you must replace ``j_institute`` by your own institute's app.
Furthermore, you may add as many apps as you like, as long as the inner order
is preserved.


.. index:: LOGIN_URL

LOGIN_URL
---------

The default URL configuration of JuliaBase puts the login view so that you
should say::

    LOGIN_URL = "/login"


.. index:: LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL

LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL
------------------

JuliaBase assumes that this setting contains the home page of the database
application.  It is used in the default templates if you click on the
“JuliaBase” name on the top.  You may simply set it to ``"/"``.


.. index:: MIDDLEWARE

MIDDLEWARE
----------

The following is a minimal set of middleware JuliaBase is working with::

    MIDDLEWARE = [
        "django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware",
        "django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware",
        "django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware",
        "jb_common.middleware.MessageMiddleware",
        "django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware",
        "django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware",
        "jb_common.middleware.LocaleMiddleware",
        "samples.middleware.juliabase.ExceptionsMiddleware",
    ]

Note that while you may add further middleware, you must not change the inner
ordering of existing middleware.


.. index:: SECRET_KEY

SECRET_KEY
----------

Note that in the :file:`settings.py` file shipped with JuliaBase, the
``SECRET_KEY`` is read from the file :file:`~/.juliabase_secret_key`.  If this
file doesn't exist, it is generated.  This is good for quickly gettings things
running and not insecure per se, but you should be aware of this.  In
particular, nobody else should have access to it.

Of course, alternatively, you may set the ``SECRET_KEY`` in a completely
different way.

A change of the secret key has the `usual impact`_ as for every Django
deployment, plus that links to Atom feeds change (with the old ones being
broken).

.. _usual impact: http://stackoverflow.com/a/15383766/188108


.. index:: TEMPLATES

TEMPLATES
---------

JuliaBase uses Django's template engine.

Make sure that you add ``"jb_common.context_processors.default"`` to the list
of ``"context processors"``.


DIRS
....

So that your can override JuliaBase's templates with own templates, you should
set in the template backend dictionary::

    "DIRS": [os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../juliabase"))]

If you don't override ``BASE_DIR``, you can write simply

::

    "DIRS": [BASE_DIR]

You may add further paths, but if your project layout is structured according
to :ref:`Organizing your source code`, this one must be present.  Then, you can
extend Juliabase templates by beginning your template with e.g.

::

    {% extends "samples/templates/samples/list_claims.html" %}


loaders
.......

In conjunction with ``DIRS`` you must make sure that Django will look
for templates first in the app directories, and then in the filesystem.  With
activated template caching, this looks like

::

    "loaders": ["django.template.loaders.cached.Loader",
                ("django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader",
                 "django.template.loaders.filesystem.Loader")]

in the ``"OPTIONS"`` dictionary, and without caching, like::

    "loaders": ["django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader",
                "django.template.loaders.filesystem.Loader"]


.. index:: USE_TZ

USE_TZ
------

You should set it to ``True`` (the default for newly created Django projects).
You even must do so if your database backend does not support timezone-aware
datetimes by itself.


.. index:: TIME_ZONE

TIME_ZONE
---------

If ``USE_TZ`` is set to ``True``, you should also consider setting
``TIME_ZONE``.  See the `Django documentation
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std:setting-TIME_ZONE>`__
for details.
