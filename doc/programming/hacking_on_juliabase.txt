Hacking on JuliaBase
====================

This *unfinished* chapter explains how to contribute to the JuliaBase project
itself instead of adapting it to your institution.


.. index:: architecture

Architecture
============

Since JuliaBase is based on the Django Web framework, it consists of several
Django apps.  The core app is called “jb_common”.  It provides functionality
which is essential for all JuliaBase components.  On top of that, the app
“samples” contains all features of a samples database.  However, it does not
contain institute-specific code in order to remain generic and flexible.  This
institute-specific code resides in an app of its own and must be created by a
skilled programmer.

JuliaBase is shipped together with an example institute app called “inm”.  It
provides not only a demo for JuliaBase, it also is a good starting point for
your own app.  Besides, essential testing of JuliaBase can only be done on top
of inm.

   pair: coding; guidelines

Coding guidelines
=================

JuliaBase source code modules should not exceed 1000 lines of code.  You should
stick to `PEP 8`_ and the `Django coding guidelines`_.  String literals are
double-quoted unless double quotes appear in them::

    "This is a string literal"
    'This is "another" string literal'

Never use ``u`` in front of a string literal.  Instead, JuliaBase code uses the
``unicode_literals`` future import.

JuliaBase makes one exception from PEP 8: It allows lines with 125 columns
instead of only 80.

All variables and source code comments should be in English.

.. _`PEP 8`: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
.. _`Django coding guidelines`: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/?from=olddocs#coding-style

.. note::

   I skip all docstrings in the code examples in this document because
   otherwise, the examples would be too bloated.  However, write rich
   Docstrings for all non-trivial functions and methods.  Write them in `ReST
   format`_.

.. _`ReST format`: http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html

Internationalization is a very important point in JuliaBase.  All strings
exposed to the user should be marked as translatable by putting them in
``_("...")`` unless you have very good reason not to do so (e.g. for some
proper names).  Note that in code which is executed at module load time
(e.g. model and form fields), ``_`` should stand for ``ugettext_lazy``, whereas
within functions and methods which are executed on each request, it should be
``ugettext``.  You may achieve this by setting ``_`` to ``ugettext_lazy`` at
the beginning of the module, and to ``ugettext`` at the end.


Boilerplate code
----------------

Start every file with:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    #
    # {Licence}

    """{Module docstring}
    """
    
    {Python standard library imports}
    {Non-standard imports (Numpy, Scipy, matplotlib etc)
    {Django imports}
    {JuliaBase imports}
