Hacking on JuliaBase
=======================

This *unfinished* chapter explains how to contribute to the JuliaBase project
itself instead of adapting it to your institution.


.. index:: architecture

Architecture
=============

Since JuliaBase is based on the Django Web framework, it consists of several
Django apps.  The core app is called “jb_common”.  It provides functionality
which is essential for all JuliaBase components.  On top of that, the app
“samples” contains all features of a samples database.  However, it does not
contain institute-specific code in order to remain generic and flexible.  This
institute-specific code resides in an app of its own and must be created by a
skilled programmer.

JuliaBase is shipped together with an example institute app called “inm”.  It
provides not only a demo for JuliaBase, it also is a good starting point for
your own app.  Besides, essential testing of JuliaBase can only be done on top
of inm.

   pair: coding; guidelines

Coding guidelines
====================

JuliaBase source code modules should not exceed 1000 lines of code.  You should
stick to `PEP 8`_ and the `Django coding guidelines`_.  String literals are
double-quoted unless double quotes appear in them::

    "This is a string literal"
    'This is "another" string literal'

Never use ``u`` in front of a string literal.  Instead, JuliaBase code uses the
``unicode_literals`` future import.

JuliaBase makes one exception from PEP 8: It allows lines with 125 columns
instead of only 80.

All variables and source code comments should be in English.

.. _`PEP 8`: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
.. _`Django coding guidelines`: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/?from=olddocs#coding-style

.. note::

   I skip all docstrings in the code examples in this document because
   otherwise, the examples would be too bloated.  However, write rich
   Docstrings for all non-trivial functions and methods.  Write them in `ReST
   format`_.

.. _`ReST format`: http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html

Internationalization is a very important point in JuliaBase.  All strings exposed
to the user should be marked as translatable by putting them in ``_("...")``
unless you have very good reason not to do so (e.g. for some proper names).
Note that in code which is executed at module load time (e.g. model and form
fields), ``_`` should stand for ``ugettext_lazy``, whereas within functions and
methods which are executed on each request, it should be ``ugettext``.


.. index:: Python 3

Python 3
--------

JuliaBase runs on both Python 2.7 and Python 3.2+.  Take care that your
contributions do the same.  We found the `Django documentation on this topic`_
extremely useful.  The remote client comes with its own copy of the ``six``
module in order to keep external dependencies at a minimum.

.. _`Django documentation on this topic`: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/python3/


Boilerplate code
----------------

Start every file with:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    #
    # {Licence}

    """{Module docstring}
    """
    
    from __future__ import absolute_import, unicode_literals, division
    {Python 3 compatibility statements}

    {Python standard library imports}
    {Non-standard imports (Numpy, Scipy, matplotlib etc)
    {Django imports}
    {JuliaBase imports}

The “Python 3 compatibility statements“ may be lines like::

    import django.utils.six as six
    from django.utils.six.moves import cStringIO as StringIO
    from django.utils.encoding import python_2_unicode_compatible
