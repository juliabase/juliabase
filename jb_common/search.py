    selection in the advanced search.  They must share a common set of fields
    though, and these fields must have the same names in the models.  If you
    need more flexibility, you can make your own derived class from
    `SearchTreeNode`.  See the ``query_paths`` parameter of
    :py:meth:`SearchField.get_values` for more information.

    An abstract node has a list of *derivatives*.  Derivatives are ordinary
    search tree nodes, typically representing non-abstrict model classes, to
    which the search fields are passed.  This means that an abstract node
    doesn't search in the search fields itself.  Instead, it lets the
    derivatives search and combines the results with the “or” operator.  Thus,
    it *any* of the derivatives returns a match, it is included into the search
    results (which may be filtered further, of course).

    For example, we have three Raman apparatuses in our institute IEK-5/FZJ.
    All three share exactly the same model fields.  Therefore, there is an
    abstract model class that all three concrete models are derived from.
    However, if you look for a certain Raman measurement, you don't know a
    priori in which if the three apparatuses it was measured.  Hence, there is
    only *one* Raman selection in the advanced view, which looks for results in
    all three models.  Note that it is still possible to focus a search to one
    particular Raman model.

    In case of Raman, the non-abstract models doesn't occur in the search form.
    However, it is also possible to have both the abstract node and all
    derivatives in the search form.  For this, you just have to give working
    ``get_search_tree_node`` methods in the derivative model classes as well.
