** TODO Find a way to get the sample ID in the process URI

This is necessary to clone the process for each sample it has worked on.

** TODO Create a clean connection between deposition and layer

And, for that matter, for sunsimulator measurement and submeasurement.

** TODO introduce a dedicated process class for external processes

** TODO enrich the external process with as much original data as possible

** TODO add views for ExternalData

** DONE namespaces of process and sample fields must be as generic as possible

Most urgent is currently the ~timestamp~ field, which comes from the 5-chamber namespace, which is perfectly potty.

** DONE adapt export of sample graph to new internal API

** DONE adapt export of sample graph to new SciMesh specification
