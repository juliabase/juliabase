** TODO namespaces of process and sample fields must be as generic as possible

Most urgent is currently the ~timestamp~ field, which comes from the 5-chamber namespace, which is perfectly potty.

** TODO adapt export of sample graph to new internal API

** TODO adapt export of sample graph to new SciMesh specification

** TODO introduce a dedicated process class for external processes

** TODO enrich the external process with as much original data as possible
