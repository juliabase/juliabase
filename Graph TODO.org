** DONE Find a way to get the sample ID in the process URI

This is necessary to clone the process for each sample it has worked on.

** DONE Create a clean connection between deposition and layer

And, for that matter, for sunsimulator measurement and submeasurement.

** TODO introduce a dedicated process class for external processes

Do we really need that?  Instead, caching fetching of external graphs may be sufficient.

** TODO enrich the external process with as much original data as possible

** DONE Replace ExternalData with URI list

I don’t need the ExternalData process anymore.  Instead, a list of URIs is maintained in a new JSON field in Sample itself.

This URI list must be minimised to minimise redundancy.  And, it must be returned in the “sm:state” properties of the sample, see https://scimesh.org/about/Implementation.html#requirements-for-elns.

** DONE namespaces of process and sample fields must be as generic as possible

Most urgent is currently the ~timestamp~ field, which comes from the 5-chamber namespace, which is perfectly potty.

** DONE adapt export of sample graph to new internal API

** DONE adapt export of sample graph to new SciMesh specification

** TODO Implement POST request against sample URIs

See https://scimesh.org/about/Implementation.html#requirements-for-elns.

** TODO Implement GET requests against process URIs

See https://scimesh.org/about/Implementation.html#requirements-for-elns.

** TODO Implement ~add_to_graph~ for all processes

The parent class’es method may already work in some cases but at least for Cluster Tool and Solarsimulator I suspect that I have to write a custom routine.

This may lead to further abstraction in the parent classes.

** DONE Move RO-Crate support from the stand-alone script into the web server

For ZIP’ing things, https://stackoverflow.com/a/44946732/188108 might come in handy.

** TODO Add bulk data to RO-Crate, at least in a simple case

Possibly I have to do that in Chantal rather than in JuliaBase.
